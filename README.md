# google-homepage-recreation

This is one of the introduction projects from The Odin Project.

The task was to replicate the classic Google homepage without just copying the CSS. This was achieved while also trying to utilise HTML semantic tags and flex boxes.

This project refreshed my knowledge on:

* HTML5 Semantic tags
* Flex boxes
* Favicons
* CSS Styling
